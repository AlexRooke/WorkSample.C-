# WorkSample.C-
Utilizing VisualStudio 2012, I developed this program in C#.NET. The first version 
was to generate up to 6 random generated numbers from 1-6 and represent them as 
rolls of a dice. All artwork was generated by me for this purpose. The second version 
was developed as a companion to Dungeons and Dragons character creation. When ' roll 
stats' is selected it generates the 6 required numbers by generating 6 numbers, dropping 
the lowest two, and adding the remaining numbers together. It then posts the numbers in a listbox.
